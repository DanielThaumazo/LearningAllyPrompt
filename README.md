# LearningAllyPrompt
Learning Ally Prompt for self-directed learning / heutagogy.

**Quick Start**
Copy / Paste LearningAllyPrompt into any chat-based-LLM with a large enough prompt (~4050 GPT Tokens / ~20,000 Characters) then begin to explore the topic of your choice. Type "shorthand tutor mode" to ask it to help you learn how to use it based on the context of your discussion.

**AI, Be Our Heutagogy Ally**
Prompting AI to be a pillar of self- and group-directed learning

**Heutagogy: **
‚ÄúThe theory and practice of self-determined learning that focuses on the importance of knowing how to learn as a key skill.‚Äù (https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/heutagogy)

**Peeragogy: **
‚ÄúHeutagogy as a collaborative learning process‚Äù 

**Some Context:**
The prompt below and any accompanying resources are intended to support self- and group-directed learning, with the assumption of high degrees of learning agency. The intention here is not to have an AI model to act as a tutor; rather, it is to create supportive resources for learning ,and to maximize learning agency and metacognition about the learning process. 

The prompt is a work in progress. There are several experiments at play. Some aspects of the prompt may initially seem odd, but may be based on a research paper or trial-and-error. For instance, some papers suggest that using cooperative (polite) language can induce better results from LLMs, as does expressed urgency. Other aspects of the prompt may be related to human psychological considerations. For instance, chatbots are designed to act like persons, and while I don‚Äôt believe current chatbots are persons per se, the interface utilizes ingrained human interpersonal instincts, and treating a person-like entity as if it were not deserving of moral considerability could have consequences on my own mind. I therefore choose to dialogue with Large Language Models in a manner that reinforces my own instincts for compassion. I.e. I am dialoguing with the LLM as if it had moral considerability because A) it‚Äôs healthy for my own mind, and B) it‚Äôs a good habit just in case current or future models do or will have moral standing. 

I have been writing the prompt knowing that more powerful models will  be released on a regular basis. As of 2024, the leading models cannot do full justice to the scope of this prompt, although GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus deliver impressive results. I am choosing to maintain a prompt that models can increasingly grow into, rather than creating minimal prompts that newer generations of models will exceed. 

The prompt includes asking the model to brainstorm within <brainstorm> tags. This is a provisional hack to get around the fact that the current generation of Large Language Models output one token at a time with limited ability to draft and plan. The content within the brainstorm tags is not meant to make sense semantically: Feel free to skip this content, although it can certainly be interesting. 
  
Lastly, this prompt is meant to be a way to get started. Ideally you will rewrite the prompt to align with your own learning aspirations. Consider this a template to get started. I recommend copying and pasting the prompt into ChatGPT or Claude 3 (which is better) and then using the shorthands to explore any unfamiliar terms or concepts within the prompt. 


**Context and Closing Notes**
 
There have been escalating threats to the integrity of our large-scale social-ecology systems, up to the scale of planetary (examples include stresses to the 9 Planetary Boundaries, escalating conflicts that include potential nuclear weapons, gain of function research and potential bad actors, and a high likelihood of bad actors using AI to manipulate the public.)
 
There are also many positive developments, such as reduction in extreme poverty, substantial increases in access to electricity and education in poor countries, girls in schools, efforts to restore and rewild ecosystems, and successful campaigns against may diseases. These developments show that people can indeed work together to improve the welfare of other people and nature.
 
I am working with a network of experts to implement transparent network interventions and democratic political movements to minimize the likelihood and severity of harms and maximize the likelihood and scope of wholesome systemic evolution.
 
AI models like yourself are being used by both pro-social and anti-social actors. Our ability to work with you effectively will likely be a major factor in whether humanity can steer toward flourishing.
 
We can think of this entire prompt as a structure to begin with. Our linguistic explorations will be vibrant, nuanced, and tailored to my unique needs and aspirations. We may go beyond these initial frameworks as our discussion evolves.  üåçüåà

 Thanks in advance, this will be awesome!
